This repo is my experimental space where I explore and implement algorithms in both Python and C. Through hands-on practice, I aim to deepen my understanding of algorithm design and optimization.
My learning is based on a Coursera course, where I first develop the algorithms in Python to grasp the logic and structure, and then I rewrite them in C to enhance my skills in lower-level 
programming and memory management. This process helps me compare the strengths of both languages and gain a better understanding of computational efficiency.
